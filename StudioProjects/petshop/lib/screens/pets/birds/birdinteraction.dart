They roost, fly, and forage in flocks. Your family is the flock for a pet bird, and it wants to be part of family activities. If your family is in one room and the bird is in its cage in another, the bird may scream to get the flock's attention. Similarly, many species of parrots mate for life. So, when a parrot bonds with one person and is showing offensive behavior toward others, it is simply protecting its â€œmate",
