          "This medium to large breed has a well-muscled athletic build with a strong, dense bone structure. This makes them surprisingly heavy for their size, which combined with their low-slung stance and often â€˜stalkyâ€™ walk, lends much to their â€˜big catâ€™ appearance, even though this is a purely domestic cat with no wild ancestry at all!
